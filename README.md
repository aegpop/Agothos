Greetings and thank you for visiting my GitHub page! Here you'll find a collection of repositories showcasing my skills, projects, and personal endeavors. As a Brazilian currently residing in Ireland, I bring a diverse perspective to my work, blending cultural influences and technical expertise.

My repositories serve a dual purpose: some are dedicated to building my professional portfolio, while others are passion projects designed to push the boundaries of my knowledge and explore various analytical parameters.

Feel free to explore my projects, and if you have any questions or inquiries, don't hesitate to reach out to me at agothosp@gmail.com. I'm always eager to collaborate and engage with fellow developers and enthusiasts.

Thank you for stopping by, and I look forward to connecting with you!

Warm regards,
Agothos
